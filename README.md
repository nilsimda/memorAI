## About
MemorAI is a project developed as part of the TUM-AI Makeathon. It tries to implement
an AI-Assistant, that utilizes reminiscence therapy to help dementia patients.

## Using a Recommender System for Reminiscence Threapy
Our system leaverages the power of one of the best language models today: GPT-3. We use GPT-3 to manage all interactions with the user, the system has a knowledge base where it keeps relevant and updated information of the user so it can make the right recommendations. These recommendations come in the form of events, songs, artists or films and have the goal of bringing back positive memories to the user and keeping its mind active through Reminiscence Therapy.


## Voice to Text
We use [Speech2Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05171g) to convert audio input into text, so the user can communicate without the need of typing. All queries made by the user are processed by GPT-3
